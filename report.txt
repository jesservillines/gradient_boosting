Gradient Boosting Algorithms: XGBoost, CatBoost, and Histogram Gradient Boosting
Introduction
Gradient boosting is an ensemble technique that builds additive decision tree models to optimize a loss function, yielding state-of-the-art results in many domains. Rather than growing a single deep tree, gradient boosting iteratively trains a sequence of small trees, each correcting errors of the previous one. This approach has won many machine learning competitions and is widely used in industry, including healthcare for tasks like disease progression prediction

. In this report, we focus on three advanced implementations of gradient boosting: XGBoost, CatBoost, and Histogram Gradient Boosting (e.g. LightGBM and its scikit-learn counterpart). We delve into the mathematical formulation of each algorithm, the history and motivation behind their development, and compare their capabilities in handling categorical features, speed/scalability, regularization (overfitting control), robustness to noise, and interpretability. We also highlight benchmarks and use cases, with a special emphasis on healthcare applications (e.g. medical diagnosis and outcome modeling).
Gradient Boosting Fundamentals
Gradient boosting (GB) trains an ensemble of $K$ trees $f_1,\dots,f_K$ by greedy stage-wise optimization of a loss function
ar5iv.org
. At iteration $t$, a new tree function $f_t(x)$ is fit to the negative gradient of the loss (the error residuals) w.r.t. the current model's predictions. Consider a dataset $D={(x_i,y_i)}{i=1}^n$ with features $x_i$ and target $y_i$. Gradient boosting seeks a model $\hat{y}i = F(x_i) = \sum{k=1}^K f_k(x_i)$ that minimizes a differentiable loss $L(y,\hat{y})$. Initially $F_0(x)$ is often a constant (e.g. mean of $y$); then for $t=1$ to $K$, we add a tree $f_t$ to improve predictions. Using a second-order Taylor approximation of the loss improvement is common (this is used in XGBoost, as described later). After fitting each tree, a shrinkage factor $\eta \in (0,1]$ is applied (learning rate) to scale down the contribution of $f_t$, which stabilizes training. Each tree $f_t(x)$ maps an input to a leaf weight $w{j}$ (a constant score). To reduce overfitting, trees are kept shallow (with depth $d$ typically $3$–$8$) so that each $f_t$ is a weak learner. The final prediction $F(x)$ is the sum of all tree outputs. This additive model is illustrated in Figure 1: each new tree corrects residual errors of the ensemble so far. Mathematically, if $\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}$ is the prediction after $t-1$ trees, we choose $f_t$ to minimize the loss:

where $\Omega(f_t)$ is a regularization term on the new tree (which may include penalties on the number of leaves and leaf weights). Taking derivatives, the gradient boosting algorithm fits $f_t(x)$ to the pseudo-residuals $r_{i}^{(t)} = -\left[\partial_{\hat{y}} L(y_i,\hat{y})\right]_{\hat{y}=\hat{y}_i^{(t-1)}}$. For efficiency, a tree’s splits are typically chosen to greedily maximize reduction in loss (analogous to reducing impurity in CART). Modern variants like XGBoost use the second derivative (Hessian) as well, fitting $f_t$ to both gradients and Hessians for a more accurate update. The core idea is that each tree $f_t$ is trained to minimize the remaining error, and the ensemble gradually improves.
XGBoost: eXtreme Gradient Boosting
History & Motivation: XGBoost was introduced by Tianqi Chen in 2014–2016 and became famous after it was used in numerous Kaggle competition winning solutions. It is essentially a refinement of Friedman’s gradient boosting with several engineering and algorithmic improvements. The motivations behind XGBoost were to improve speed and scalability (through parallelization, cache optimization, and out-of-core computation) and to enhance model regularization for better generalization. By 2016, XGBoost was the “go-to” algorithm for many machine learning tasks, credited with state-of-the-art results in classification, regression, and ranking tasks. It introduced a novel regularized learning objective and support for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate splits. Mathematical Formulation: XGBoost uses the standard gradient boosting framework but adds a regularized objective. For a set of $K$ trees $f_k \in F$ (where $F$ is the space of CART-like trees), XGBoost minimizes:

where $l(\hat{y},y)$ is the training loss (e.g. squared error or logistic loss), $T$ is the number of leaves in tree $f$, $w_j$ is the weight of leaf $j$, and $\gamma,\lambda$ are regularization parameters. This regularization term $\Omega(f)$ penalizes large trees (many leaves $T$) and large leaf weights (L2 regularization) to control complexity and avoid overfitting. In practice XGBoost also allows an $L1$ penalty $\alpha \sum_j |w_j|$ (lasso) to encourage sparsity in the leaves, so one may have $\Omega(f)=\gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \sum_j w_j^2 + \alpha \sum_j |w_j|$. When $\gamma=\lambda=\alpha=0$, this objective reduces to standard gradient boosting. XGBoost uses a second-order Taylor expansion of the loss improvement to choose splits efficiently. Let $g_i = \partial_{\hat{y}} l(y_i,\hat{y})$ and $h_i = \partial^2_{\hat{y}} l(y_i,\hat{y})$ be the first and second derivatives of the loss for sample $i$ with respect to the model prediction. If we add a tree $f(x)$, the objective improvement (ignoring constants) can be approximated as:

where $I_L,I_R$ are the left and right node sample sets if the split is applied (and $I=I_L \cup I_R$). XGBoost enumerates candidate splits and chooses the one with maximum Gain (if that max is positive). By using sorted feature values or an efficient quantile sketch, it can quickly compute these sums for splits. XGBoost further speeds this up with block-aware parallelization and cache-aware prefetching to utilize CPU caches efficiently. It also supports an approximate histogram-based algorithm for even faster split finding on large data, which bins continuous features into discrete bins (we discuss this in the HistGradientBoosting section). Key Features: Several features make XGBoost eXtreme:
Regularization: XGBoost’s inclusion of the $\Omega(f)$ term with parameters $\lambda$ (L2) and $\gamma$ (minimum split loss) acts like a built-in pruning mechanism. A node is only split if the loss reduction exceeds $\gamma$ (similar to a minimum impurity decrease). This helps prevent overfitting by making trees conservative. It was unique at the time among GBM implementations. Additionally, column (feature) subsampling can be used at each split or tree (like Random Forests) to further reduce overfitting and improve speed
kdd.org
. Shrinkage (learning rate) is also applied each step. These controls make XGBoost robust to overfitting if tuned properly.
Handling Missing/Sparse Data: XGBoost can naturally skip over missing values. It treats missing as a separate choice when splitting and learns the best direction to send missing values (left or right) based on which yields lower loss. This “sparsity-aware split finding” means that features with lots of missing or zeros (sparse features) are handled efficiently without preprocessing. This is advantageous in datasets like healthcare where missing values are common.
Scalability and Speed: XGBoost was designed for distributed and multi-core computing. It can distribute training across cores and machines, perform out-of-core computation for huge datasets (using disk when RAM is insufficient), and even utilize GPU acceleration. For example, the “exact” greedy algorithm is parallelized, and an approximate algorithm using histograms can further accelerate training on larger data by trading some accuracy for speed. XGBoost’s creators note it can scale to billions of examples on commodity hardware.
Objective Flexibility: XGBoost supports custom objectives and a variety of loss functions (regression, classification, pairwise ranking losses, etc.). It uses the specified loss’s gradient and Hessian for boosting, which allows optimization of user-defined loss functions as long as they are differentiable.
Historical Note: By 2015, XGBoost was credited in 17 out of 29 winning solutions on Kaggle, either alone or in ensembles, demonstrating its prowess.
Handling Categorical Variables: Originally, XGBoost did not provide special handling for categorical features – users had to one-hot encode or label-encode them prior to training. Recent versions have added some support (when using pandas DataFrames, XGBoost can detect category dtype and try to find optimal splits of categories). Internally, one approach is to find the best partition of categories into two groups by sorting them according to the learned statistics (similar to LightGBM’s method). However, this is still rudimentary compared to CatBoost’s approach. In practice, many XGBoost users rely on manual encoding or leave categorical as integer and let the tree sort them by numeric order (which may be arbitrary). Thus, XGBoost’s ability to capture categorical patterns depends on the encoding strategy. It does not have the ordered target encoding or built-in one-hot of CatBoost. Therefore, when many categorical features are present, XGBoost might need careful preprocessing to avoid losing information or causing target leakage. Performance in Practice: XGBoost generally delivers excellent accuracy on structured data. It often matches or slightly beats other boosting variants on many benchmarks after hyperparameter tuning. It has been widely applied in healthcare: e.g. predicting stroke risk and sepsis onset where it outperformed baseline models
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, and many other disease prediction studies. For example, Pan et al. used XGBoost to predict COVID-19 ICU mortality and found it achieved the best discrimination (AUROC) using a set of 8 key risk factors. XGBoost’s popularity stems from this strong predictive performance combined with reasonable training speed and robustness. However, newer algorithms like LightGBM can train faster on large datasets, and CatBoost can outperform XGBoost when categorical feature handling is crucial or data are noisy.
Histogram Gradient Boosting (LightGBM & Scikit-Learn)
History & Motivation: LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) was released by Microsoft in 2017 as an efficient GBM implementation. The motivation was to address the scalability limitations of XGBoost on very large datasets with high dimensionality. XGBoost’s exact greedy algorithm can become slow or memory-heavy when there are many features or when data do not fit in cache. LightGBM introduced a suite of innovations: histogram-based splitting, leaf-wise tree growth, and advanced sampling techniques, to significantly speed up training without much loss in accuracy. Around the same time, scikit-learn integrated a similar approach in its HistGradientBoostingClassifier/Regressor (HGB) – a histogram-based gradient booster (in version 0.21+, with improvements in v0.24 adding categorical support). HistGradientBoosting in scikit-learn is essentially inspired by LightGBM’s techniques, making gradient boosting more efficient within the scikit-learn library. Histogram-Based Splitting: Unlike XGBoost’s exact split search (which sorts feature values and evaluates many split points), LightGBM/HGB first bin continuous features into discrete bins (a fixed number, e.g. 255 bins) to create a feature histogram. For each feature, instead of trying every possible threshold, the algorithm only considers splits at the bin boundaries. This provides an approximate split search that is much faster because it operates on bin counts rather than individual samples. Binning incurs a slight loss of precision, but with sufficient bins (256 is often default), the impact on accuracy is minimal while the speed gain is large. Histogram aggregation also allows efficient multi-threading. XGBoost later incorporated a similar “hist” mode, but LightGBM was built around it from scratch with additional optimizations. Leaf-Wise Tree Growth: Another difference is how trees are grown. Classic GBM (and XGBoost by default) grow trees level-by-level (depth-wise), splitting all nodes of a given depth before moving deeper. LightGBM uses a leaf-wise (best-first) strategy: at each step it splits the leaf that yields the largest loss reduction (even if other leaves remain unsplit). This can lead to unbalanced trees that are deeper on one side. The advantage is that it minimizes loss faster (greedily focusing on the most significant split) and often achieves lower loss with the same number of leaves. The downside is the risk of overfitting: leaf-wise growth can create very deep branches if not limited, so a max depth or max leaves parameter is typically used to constrain complexity. Empirically, leaf-wise growth tends to give slightly better accuracy for the same number of leaves, at the cost of a less interpretable tree structure and potential overfit on small data. Scikit’s HGB by default uses a hybrid approach: it specifies max_leaf_nodes (default 31) to limit leaf count, which effectively controls depth as well. This keeps the tree from growing too pathological. In summary, LightGBM’s trees may have many levels but will stop splitting when the max leaves or minimal gain requirements are reached. Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (GOSS): LightGBM introduces a sampling technique to handle cases with huge numbers of data rows. Instead of sampling uniformly, GOSS retains instances with large gradients (the ones the model currently fits poorly) and only samples among those with small gradients. The idea (inspired by AdaBoost) is that instances with small gradients are already well-predicted and can be subsampled without much effect on learning. By keeping all the challenging examples (large error) and only a fraction of the easy ones, LightGBM can build trees using fewer data points while preserving accuracy, thus speeding up each iteration. This is beneficial when n (number of samples) is extremely large. Notably, standard scikit-learn HGB does not implement GOSS, it uses all samples; GOSS is unique to LightGBM’s implementation. Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB): LightGBM also tackles high dimensionality (large m, number of features) via EFB, which bundles sparse features that rarely activate together into a single combined feature. For example, in one-hot encoded data, many features are mutually exclusive. EFB will merge such features into one feature with multiple categorical levels (or into different bits of a single feature), reducing the number of features to consider. This can dramatically reduce computational cost for datasets with thousands of sparse features without losing information. Scikit-learn’s HGB does not explicitly mention EFB, so this is a LightGBM-specific optimization. Mathematical Formulation: The underlying objective function for LightGBM/HGB is the same form as XGBoost’s (and indeed most boosters). LightGBM also supports an $L2$ leaf weight regularization (parameter often called lambda_l2) and an $L1$ term (lambda_l1), along with a minimum split gain (min_gain_to_split, analogous to $\gamma$). Thus, it is also solving a regularized objective like Equation (1) and uses similar formulas for optimal leaf weights and split gains. The difference is that LightGBM finds approximate split candidates via histograms. After binning, it computes for each bin the sum of $g_i$ and $h_i$ of instances falling in that bin. Then to evaluate a split between bin $b$ and $b+1$, it uses these binned sums instead of summing over each instance. This is faster but slightly approximate because the exact within-bin split position is not distinguished. In practice, this approximation has little effect if many bins are used. In fact, with histogram splitting the training speed can improve by an order of magnitude while losing only ~1% in accuracy if at all. Handling Categorical Variables: LightGBM provides native support for categorical features by a method of pairwise category partitioning. The algorithm sorts categories by their average label (target mean) or another heuristic at each split, then finds the optimal split as a division of the sorted categories into two groups that maximizes information gain. In effect, it treats the categorical feature as having an ordered sequence (according to target statistic) and finds a cutoff. This often works better than arbitrary label encoding. However, research has found that this method isn’t always superior to one-hot encoding for every dataset. It is a fast heuristic, but not as sophisticated as CatBoost’s strategy. LightGBM also supports specifying categorical features so that they are not one-hot encoded but directly fed, which saves memory. Scikit-learn’s HistGradientBoosting gained similar capability in v0.24: one can pass categorical_features and it will find optimal binary partitions of categories. The only constraint is that the number of unique categories ≤ max_bins (since categories get binned as well). Under the hood, scikit-learn’s method also sorts categories by their accumulated gradient stats to decide splits. If categories are numerous, this sorting can be slower than treating them as ordered integers, but it avoids imposing a false ordinal relationship. Empirically, native categorical handling in HGB can outperform simple ordinal encoding and approaches the performance of one-hot encoding without the high dimensionality, especially when combined with enough max_bins. Still, CatBoost’s approach remains the most advanced for categorical data (discussed next). Speed and Scalability: Histogram-based boosting is extremely fast and memory-efficient. Binning the data allows representing feature values with just 8-bit or 16-bit integers (for up to 255 or 65k bins), making the memory footprint small. LightGBM leverages multi-threading to build histograms in parallel for different features. It also supports GPU training by constructing histograms on the GPU (which benefits from the reduced precision). In practice, LightGBM is often an order of magnitude faster than XGBoost on large datasets. For example, one comparison reported LightGBM was 10x faster than XGBoost with almost no loss in accuracy. Scikit-learn’s HGB, while not as tuned as LightGBM, also significantly outperforms the original GradientBoostingClassifier in training speed due to these techniques (and is easier to use for Python users not installing external libraries). LightGBM can also distribute training across clusters similar to XGBoost if needed. Regularization & Overfitting Control: LightGBM inherits standard GBM regularization: shrinkage (learning rate), limiting tree depth or leaves, L1/L2 penalties on leaf weights, row and column subsampling, and early stopping. Because of the leaf-wise growth which can overfit if unchecked, users often set num_leaves (max leaves per tree) carefully relative to the number of training samples. A rule of thumb is to ensure $num_leaves < \text{number of samples per class}$ to avoid overfitting. LightGBM by default has no max depth but does have num_leaves=31 default, which roughly corresponds to a max depth of 5 (since a balanced tree with depth 5 has $2^5=32$ leaves). In addition, min_data_in_leaf (min samples per leaf) defaults to 20, which also prevents overly deep splits on little data. These defaults make LightGBM quite robust out-of-the-box for moderately sized data. Nonetheless, if num_leaves is set very large and learning rate is high, LightGBM can overfit noisy data by creating very specific rules. This can be mitigated by increasing min_gain_to_split (the $\gamma$ threshold) so that splits need to yield a certain improvement, and by using early stopping on a validation set to halt boosting when performance stops improving. Overall, with proper parameter tuning, LightGBM does not tend to overfit more than XGBoost; in fact one might allow LightGBM to use more leaves but counteract with stronger shrinkage. Use in Practice: LightGBM and HGB have become popular for problems with large datasets (e.g. millions of examples, high-dimensional features) due to their speed. They have been used in biomedical applications like genomics (where p ≫ n) and in healthcare data involving large patient databases. For example, LightGBM has been applied to insurance claim predictions and medical risk modeling when the dataset is huge and computational efficiency is needed. In many Kaggle competitions post-2017, LightGBM often edged out XGBoost for speed, allowing more aggressive hyperparameter searches. In terms of accuracy, LightGBM usually performs on par with XGBoost. In some cases with very large sparse features (like text or one-hot encoded categories), LightGBM’s exclusive bundling can give it an edge. In contrast, if the dataset is small or medium and speed is less a concern, XGBoost and LightGBM often tie; any slight difference might come down to how they handle categorical variables or other details. One study comparing these boosters on medium-sized datasets found that their ROC AUC scores were nearly equivalent (differences <0.005) after tuning, with LightGBM training much faster. Interpretability: The histogram/leaf-wise approach does not change the fact that the model is an ensemble of decision trees. Interpretability is similar to XGBoost: one can compute feature importances (based on information gain or split frequency) and use tools like SHAP values for explanation. One caveat is that because LightGBM’s trees can be unbalanced and features might be bundled, interpreting individual tree splits might be slightly less straightforward. For instance, if two features were bundled into one, a split on that bundled feature is not directly intelligible without unpacking it. However, this scenario is rare unless many one-hot features were present. In general, LightGBM models are as interpretable (or as opaque) as any gradient boosted trees model – they require examination of many shallow trees or use of summary tools.
CatBoost: Categorical Boosting
History & Motivation: CatBoost was developed by Yandex and released in 2017–2018 by Prokhorenkova et al.. The name stands for "Categorical Boosting" because it uniquely focuses on handling categorical features. The developers identified a problem present in other boosting algorithms: prediction shift due to target leakage. In standard boosting, each tree is trained using the entire training set’s true targets. As boosting progresses, later trees effectively get to see the true target of each data point (via the residuals) after earlier trees have been fitted. This can cause subtle bias when the model is used on new data (test set), because the model has in a sense overly “fit” the training target distribution. This issue is especially pronounced when using target encoding for categorical features: if you convert categories to mean target value using the whole training set, you leak information and get an overly optimistic model. CatBoost introduces two key algorithmic advances to fix these issues: Ordered Boosting and Ordered Target Statistics. These techniques aim to eliminate target leakage and reduce overfitting, thereby improving generalization, especially on datasets with many categorical features or small samples. Ordered Boosting: In ordered boosting, when training the $t$-th tree, CatBoost does not use the true residuals computed from the model on the entire training set. Instead, it simulates an online learning scenario: it processes training examples in a random order and, for each example, ensures that the model (ensemble) only has seen prior examples in that order. In practice, CatBoost generates random permutations of the training set. For each permutation, when training each new tree, it uses a prefix of that permutation to compute residuals, ensuring that when evaluating the loss for a given data point, only points earlier in the permutation contributed to the model. This way, no data point “sees” its own target in the residuals used to fit the next tree. The algorithm is quite involved: CatBoost maintains multiple “supporting models” under the hood, but conceptually it means each tree is trained in a way that is unbiased with respect to the target distribution. The result is that CatBoost avoids the prediction shift problem and tends to not overfit as quickly, especially in early iterations. Ordered boosting is computationally expensive if implemented naively (since one might train $n$ different models for $n$ data points). CatBoost’s implementation uses clever caching and multiple random permutations to make it feasible. The user can choose between Ordered and Plain boosting modes; Plain is the traditional algorithm (like XGBoost’s) and is faster, but Ordered is the default because it usually yields better accuracy on messy data. Categorical Feature Encoding: CatBoost’s other innovation is in how it encodes categorical features. Instead of one-hot encoding (which can blow up feature dimensionality) or naive label encoding (which imposes an arbitrary ordering), CatBoost uses target statistics (also known as mean encoding or likelihood encoding). For a categorical feature value (say “Diagnosis = X”), a target statistic could be the mean of the target for all training samples where that category appears. This provides a numerical representation capturing the category’s relationship to the target. However, using the global mean would introduce leakage (each data point’s target contributes to its own encoding). So CatBoost computes these statistics in an ordered manner as well. For each data point in a permutation, the category mean is calculated using only earlier examples in that permutation, not including the current example. Additionally, CatBoost uses a Bayesian approach to avoid high variance for rare categories: it incorporates a prior in the mean calculation. The formula is typically:

​
 , where $\bar{y}$ is the global average target and $\alpha$ is a prior weight (a hyperparameter). This way, if a category has few samples, its encoding is shrunk towards the global average. These encoded values (which they call Ordered Target Statistics, TS) are used as features for splitting in the trees. CatBoost also employs one-hot encoding for low-cardinality categoricals (by default if a feature has ≤ 15 unique values, it will one-hot encode it fully, since that is not too high-dimensional). High-cardinality features use the described target statistic encoding. By combining one-hot (exact, for small cats) and target mean (for large cats), CatBoost leverages categorical info with minimal information loss. These strategies effectively handle categorical features automatically – the user can feed categories as strings or integers, and CatBoost takes care of encoding internally. This is a major convenience and often yields better performance than manual encoding. The CatBoost paper shows that without ordered encoding, using target mean can lead to a big overestimation of model quality (because of target leakage), which their algorithm fixes. Tree Structure and Learning: CatBoost uses symmetric trees by default. A symmetric (or oblivious) tree is one where each level uses the same splitting criterion for all nodes. In other words, at depth $d$, all nodes split on the same feature and threshold. This yields a balanced tree where all leaves are at the same depth (number of leaves is $2^d$). The reason for this design is partly historical (Yandex’s older boosting library also used symmetric trees) and partly to mitigate variance and allow faster runtime predictions. Because the tree structure is constrained, the model might be slightly less prone to overfitting the structure to idiosyncrasies. Symmetric trees also make it easier to vectorize computations during training and applying the model (since you apply the same splits for a batch of instances). This design contrasts with the arbitrary structure of XGBoost/LightGBM trees. While symmetric trees can be slightly less flexible, CatBoost typically uses deeper trees (depth 6–8) but fewer trees in the ensemble as a result. Note that CatBoost does allow asymmetric trees if you disable the symmetric-tree option, but most documented use cases stick with the default. Regularization & Other Features: CatBoost inherently fights overfitting via its ordered boosting and encoding, so it often requires less manual regularization. Still, it provides hyperparameters akin to other boosters: L2 leaf reg (parameter l2_leaf_reg which defaults to 3) adds a ridge penalty on leaf values, and early stopping options (they call it overfitting detector). One notable difference: CatBoost currently does not support L1 regularization on leaf weights – only L2 is implemented. In practice, this is not a major issue; L2 is usually sufficient. CatBoost also has built-in cross-validation and an innovative model averaging at the end of training to reduce overfit (it can average the last few trees if an overfitting detector triggers). Another feature is minimal variance sampling (MVS), a technique CatBoost can use instead of GOSS for sampling data for splits. MVS tries to maintain accurate gradient estimates when subsampling, by picking samples such that the variance of the gradient estimate is minimized (somewhat analogous goal to GOSS, but different method). Speed and Scalability: Early versions of CatBoost were slower than XGBoost/LightGBM because ordered boosting and computing target stats for each permutation had overhead. However, CatBoost has improved and supports multi-core CPU and GPU training. On GPU, CatBoost is highly optimized – it often outperforms XGBoost’s GPU and can match or beat LightGBM’s GPU, especially for large datasets with many features. For example, in one benchmark with 400K samples and 2000 features, CatBoost GPU trained in 18 seconds vs 110 seconds for LightGBM and 890 seconds for XGBoost on GPU, a massive speed advantage. On CPU, CatBoost can also be very fast: in that same task it finished in 527s versus XGBoost’s 4339s and LightGBM’s 1146s. (This likely reflects CatBoost’s efficient multi-threading and fewer trees due to symmetric splits.) On another dataset (Higgs, 4M rows, 28 features), CatBoost CPU took 770s vs LightGBM’s 438s (XGBoost 881s), while CatBoost GPU took 32s vs LightGBM’s 94s. These mixed results indicate that performance depends on dataset shape and hardware: CatBoost might be fastest for high-dimensional data or on powerful GPUs, whereas LightGBM shines for very large row counts on CPU. Overall, CatBoost’s speed is now very competitive, and it supports distributed training across multiple servers (with GPUs) for massive tasks

Figure 1: Training speed comparison on a large dataset (Epsilon, 400K samples × 2000 features) using CPU vs. GPU. CatBoost shows significantly faster training on both CPU (due to efficient implementation and fewer trees needed) and GPU (due to optimized GPU kernels), compared to XGBoost and LightGBM. Robustness to Noisy Data: CatBoost’s developers highlight its stability on datasets with noise or small samples, thanks to the ordered approach that reduces overfitting. By not allowing a data point to “inform itself” through target encoding or residual calculations, CatBoost tends to generalize better when data is limited. This can be valuable in medical datasets, which often have noisy measurements and a mix of categorical indicators. Moreover, CatBoost’s use of symmetric trees (which are less flexible) can act as an additional regularizer. There is some evidence that when label noise is extremely high, even CatBoost (and any boosting method) will struggle and might be outperformed by simpler models or neural networks. But in moderate noise settings, CatBoost is observed to be more robust than standard GBM. For example, in a healthcare cost prediction study, CatBoost was found to handle irregularities and missing values without special preprocessing, yielding strong results where other boosters required careful tuning. All three algorithms can use robust loss functions (like Huber or quantile losses) to mitigate outlier effects, but CatBoost’s inherent leakage prevention is a unique advantage against subtle overfitting due to noise. Interpretability: As with the others, CatBoost is an ensemble of trees, so inherently it’s a complex model. However, CatBoost provides tools for interpretability: it has an integrated visualization tool CatBoost Viewer and supports SHAP and permutation feature importance. In fact, CatBoost models can use SHAP values just like XGBoost/LightGBM to explain predictions feature by feature. One aspect to consider is how to interpret the influence of categorical features that were target-encoded. In CatBoost, a high-cardinality categorical doesn’t appear as 100 dummy features (as it would with one-hot) but instead as one feature (the target statistic). This actually simplifies the interpretation in some sense: you can see the effect of that encoded feature on predictions. But mapping it back to the original category levels is non-trivial – one might need to compute what encoding value a particular category had, and how a split on that value translates to a subset of categories. CatBoost’s documentation suggests using techniques like SHAP to get the importance of each original category if needed. The symmetric tree structure might make the model slightly more constrained, but interpretability of each tree rule is similar (each node is a condition like “EncodedFeature_A ≤ 0.42”). For critical applications like healthcare, one can use CatBoost and then analyze feature importances to validate that the model is using medically relevant factors; CatBoost’s own makers demonstrated interpreting the model for ICU mortality with SHAP, partial dependence plots, and LIME. In a study by Safaei et al., CatBoost identified the top 10 risk factors for ICU mortality and they could examine how changing each factor affected predictions. Thus, with the right tools, CatBoost models can be made as interpretable as any decision-tree ensemble.
Comparative Analysis of XGBoost, LightGBM/HistGBM, and CatBoost
Now we compare these algorithms side by side on key aspects:
Handling of Categorical Variables
XGBoost: Requires manual handling of categorical data. Typically, one-hot encoding or label encoding is done prior to training. The algorithm itself treats all features as numeric continuous values. If label-encoded integers are used, the tree might split based on the numeric ordering which could be meaningless. Newer XGBoost versions allow an enable_categorical parameter to treat certain features as categorical, which then tries all binary splits of that category set (or uses sorting by target value) during tree construction. This is essentially an approximate brute force over subsets or an ordinal heuristic, and it comes with computational cost if categories are numerous. In most cases, XGBoost users still rely on careful preprocessing. Therefore, XGBoost is less convenient for high-cardinality categoricals.
LightGBM / HistGradientBoosting: Provides native support via an optimal split for categories. The algorithm will order categories by some criterion (like target mean) and find the best split point (dividing categories into two groups) that maximizes gain. This avoids having to create many dummy variables. It works well when there is a strong target signal in categorical levels. However, if there are many categories, the search space for splits is $2^{k-1}-1$ possible divisions (exponential), so LightGBM uses a greedy approach rather than evaluating all subsets. It sorts by the sum of gradients, then finds one split. This heuristic may not always find the globally optimal grouping. Empirically, LightGBM’s native categorical splits often perform similarly to one-hot encoding, and sometimes slightly worse or better depending on data. The big advantage is efficiency: it can handle moderate-$k$ categoricals without blowing up feature count. Scikit-learn’s HGB follows the same approach. However, both LightGBM and HGB have a limitation that the number of unique categories must be $\leq max_bins$ (default 255). If a categorical has more unique values than that, one must increase max_bins or pre-process to group rare categories.
CatBoost: Purpose-built to handle categorical features. It natively accepts categorical columns and applies its ordered target encoding internally with no information leakage. It also automatically one-hot encodes low-cardinality features (configurable threshold). This means CatBoost can directly ingest data with strings like “Male/Female” or “High/Medium/Low” etc., as well as things like ZIP codes with hundreds of levels. The algorithm’s use of target statistics with Bayesian smoothing often gives it a boost in accuracy on data where categorical values have predictive power. For example, if certain medical diagnosis codes are associated with higher risk, CatBoost will capture that through the encoded value. The ordered encoding ensures that even with small datasets, it doesn’t leak target info. This sets CatBoost apart: in many Kaggle competitions or research tasks with categorical data, CatBoost out-of-the-box performs excellently with minimal preprocessing. The downside might be that CatBoost’s approach is more complex and has a higher computational overhead per iteration (maintaining those stats). But this is usually worth it if categoricals are important features. In contrast, one could mimic CatBoost’s effect in XGBoost/LightGBM by manually doing target encoding with proper regularization and folding, but CatBoost does it automatically and rigorously.
Summary: CatBoost is the clear winner for ease-of-use with categoricals and often for accuracy when category effects are non-linear. LightGBM’s method is effective and faster, but might require some tuning and won’t always beat a well-done one-hot encoding. XGBoost historically lags here, requiring more manual effort. In a dataset with mostly numeric features, all three are on equal footing; but with many categorical features (e.g. insurance data, survey responses), CatBoost tends to shine.
Speed and Scalability
Single-machine speed: LightGBM (HistGB) is generally the fastest on CPU for large datasets. Its histogram binning and leaf-wise strategy make it very efficient per tree. It often trains to the same loss in much less time than XGBoost. XGBoost’s histogram mode narrows this gap, but LightGBM’s additional techniques still give it an edge. CatBoost has become surprisingly fast due to multi-core optimizations and fewer trees needed for convergence (thanks to symmetric trees and perhaps better usage of info). In benchmarks, CatBoost and LightGBM usually both significantly outperform XGBoost in training speed. For example, on a 10 million instance dataset, LightGBM might finish in a few minutes where classic XGBoost could take over an hour. Scikit-learn’s HGB, implemented in Cython, is also quite fast – not as fast as LightGBM in all cases, but much faster than the original sklearn GBM.
Scalability to large data: All three can handle large-$n$ (millions of rows). XGBoost and LightGBM both support distributed training across multiple machines. LightGBM is highly optimized for huge data, and has been used in production for very large click-prediction problems. XGBoost has been used with out-of-core (disk) training for tens of millions of instances, though one must carefully tune it. CatBoost can also distribute over multiple servers (including multi-GPU setups)
neptune.ai
neptune.ai
. In terms of memory usage, LightGBM is frugal due to 8-bit binning. XGBoost can use more memory if using the exact algorithm (for storing sorted copies of data), though the hist mode and sparse awareness mitigate this. CatBoost memory usage is higher because it needs to store permutations and dynamic encodings; for very large datasets, this overhead can be significant. In practice for typical dataset sizes (up to a few million), CatBoost is fine. For extremely large jobs, LightGBM might be preferred due to its simplicity and lower resource usage.
GPU training: XGBoost and LightGBM both have GPU histogram algorithms that speed up training dramatically for large data (especially if many features). CatBoost also has an excellent GPU implementation. On benchmarks, CatBoost often comes out fastest on GPU, possibly because it was designed with GPU in mind from early on. LightGBM’s GPU is also very fast and can handle large batch sizes. XGBoost’s GPU historically had issues with very high dimensional data (as seen in the Epsilon dataset result, where XGBoost GPU was much slower than CatBoost and LightGBM GPU). With ongoing updates, all three are improving. If you have a GPU and a moderately large dataset, using GPU with any of these can give 5-10x speedups. CatBoost in particular scales well with multiple GPUs and even multiple nodes of GPUs.
Hyperparameter tuning overhead: Because LightGBM is so fast, one can train many variants to tune parameters quickly. XGBoost, being slower, can make thorough tuning more time-consuming. CatBoost sits in between; it has many parameters too, but often its default settings (ordered boosting, etc.) are reasonable, so one might not need to tune as much. In some cases, CatBoost’s automatic handling of categories saves time that one would otherwise spend encoding data for XGBoost/LightGBM.
Summary: LightGBM/HGB is typically the fastest for big data on CPU, while CatBoost often wins on GPU or for high-dimensional data. XGBoost is the slowest of the three in many scenarios, though it offers robust distributed training options. If you need to train models very quickly or iterate a lot (e.g. in automated ML pipelines), LightGBM is a strong choice. For extremely large-scale problems or when using powerful GPU hardware, CatBoost can leverage that well. XGBoost remains very scalable but just not as light as LightGBM.
Regularization and Overfitting Control
All three algorithms incorporate the basic regularization techniques of gradient boosting (shrinkage, tree depth constraints, etc.), but there are some differences:
XGBoost: It explicitly includes regularization terms in the objective for L2 and L1 penalties on leaf weights and a minimum loss reduction $\gamma$ for splits. This was a novel addition at XGBoost’s release and is one of its strengths. By tuning lambda (L2) and alpha (L1), users can reduce overfitting (L1 can drive some leaf weights to 0, effectively prunings parts of the tree). XGBoost also has a parameter max_depth (default 6) to limit tree depth; if deeper interaction is needed, one can increase it at risk of overfitting. Often, using subsample (row subsampling, default 1.0 but commonly set to ~0.8) and colsample_bytree (feature subsampling) further regularize the model similar to random forests. Shrinkage (learning_rate) is crucial: XGBoost with a small learning rate (e.g. 0.05 or 0.1) and many trees will generalize better than a large learning rate with few trees. XGBoost also supports early stopping if provided a validation set: it will stop adding trees when performance doesn’t improve, to avoid overfitting to training data. Overall, XGBoost is known for being relatively robust if these parameters are well-chosen – it doesn’t easily overfit small noise as long as $\eta$ is low and depth is reasonable. However, if one naively sets learning_rate high and depth high, XGBoost can overfit just like any flexible model.
LightGBM/HGB: LightGBM similarly has lambda_l1, lambda_l2, min_gain_to_split (same role as $\gamma$) and so on. By default, it puts a tiny L2 reg on (0 or 1 depending on version) and no L1, but it’s easy to add. The main thing to watch is the leaf-wise growth: if num_leaves is too large relative to data, the model can memorize noise. A common approach is to set num_leaves such that $num_leaves < 2^{max_depth}$ for some reasonable max_depth. For example, if you conceptually don’t want more than depth 8, use num_leaves=256. The min_data_in_leaf parameter (which defaults to 20) is a powerful regularizer too – it means a leaf must have at least 20 samples, preventing splits that isolate single samples (which could be noise). Scikit’s HGB uses min_samples_leaf=20 by default, similar effect. LightGBM also has an extra_trees option (very similar to Scikit’s ExtraTrees) where it picks thresholds randomly for splits among top candidates, adding an element of randomness that can help generalization at some slight loss of accuracy. In practice, LightGBM often needs a bit more careful tuning on small datasets because the combination of leaf-wise growth and default depth constraints (or lack thereof) could overfit. But on larger datasets, it’s quite stable. LightGBM can also do early stopping based on eval data. One difference: XGBoost uses the weighted quantile sketch for exactly sorting values when using exact algorithm; LightGBM’s histogram is a form of regularization itself (since it smooths values). In fact, using fewer bins (like 64 instead of 256) will speed up training but also make the tree less sensitive to tiny value differences – this can act like a form of feature value regularization.
CatBoost: CatBoost’s primary defense against overfitting is its algorithmic design (ordered boosting). This means that even with relatively deep trees and many iterations, it is less prone to fitting noise patterns that don’t generalize. The ordered target encoding also prevents a major source of leakage-overfitting that one would encounter if doing mean encoding improperly. So CatBoost often generalizes well with default settings, even without heavy-handed regularization. By default, it uses depth 6 trees and can grow to thousands of trees if needed. The parameter l2_leaf_reg (L2 penalty) defaults to 3 (some regularization). Users typically tune this if they see overfitting – increasing it to 5, 10, or higher will make leaves closer to 0 (more conservative). CatBoost does not have a direct $\gamma$ parameter, but it has random_strength, which adds randomness to split selection (by randomly permuting or adding noise to the gain) to avoid greedily always picking the same splits on repetitive data. This effectively serves to reduce variance. Another CatBoost-specific option is an overfitting detector that can stop training early or reduce learning rate if it detects metric deterioration. It can do this based on a holdout or even based on the last iterations trend. Because CatBoost’s baseline accuracy is high, one might not need too many trees – this in itself is a form of capacity control (fewer trees = simpler model).
Summary: XGBoost provides the most explicit regularization controls (which advanced users appreciate), LightGBM relies on sensible defaults (leaf limits, etc.) plus user tuning, and CatBoost tries to avoid overfitting inherently and often requires least tuning. In many comparisons on benchmark datasets, all three can achieve similar test performance when properly regularized. If one observes overfitting (training metric much better than validation metric), the approaches are: lower depth/leaves, add L2 reg, increase min samples per leaf, or lower learning rate and use early stopping. All three algorithms offer these levers in some form.
Robustness to Noisy Data
XGBoost: Thanks to shrinkage and regularization, XGBoost is fairly robust to moderate label noise or feature noise. The use of second-order information can also help stabilize training in the presence of outliers (Hessians down-weight samples with large error if using logistic loss, for instance, because the prediction is bounded). However, as a gradient boosting method, XGBoost can overfit on mislabeled points if run for too many rounds. Each boosting step tries to correct errors, including those due to noise; if a data point has a random label, the model may create a branch specifically for it. Techniques like early stopping after a certain number of rounds of no improvement are important to stop before the model starts fitting pure noise. XGBoost also allows using a robust loss (for regression, one could use a Huber loss or quantile loss to reduce sensitivity to outliers). In classification, using logistic loss, outliers (samples that are very hard to classify) won’t overly dominate because the gradients saturate as probabilities approach 0 or 1. So XGBoost tends to handle some noise gracefully. But if a dataset has a lot of noisy features, one should use feature subsampling to avoid the model relying on spurious variables. In practice, XGBoost has been successfully used on noisy medical data (e.g., lab measurements with error) and still performed well by focusing on the strongest signals
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.
LightGBM/HGB: Similar considerations as XGBoost (which it shares many traits with). One potential difference: LightGBM’s histogram binning might make it slightly more robust to noise in feature values, because continuous noise variations under the bin size are absorbed. For example, if a feature has some random jitter, as long as it falls into the same bin it won’t affect the split decision. In contrast, XGBoost exact might try to find a split on that jitter if it correlates with target by chance. So histogram approach can act like a form of smoothing. Also, LightGBM’s leaf-wise splits could, in worst case, overfit noise if not constrained, but with min_data_in_leaf, it won’t create a leaf for a single noisy sample. Scikit’s HGB by default having 20 minimum samples per leaf and a max of 31 leaves means it’s quite constrained and likely very robust – it won’t chase individual outliers. Indeed, experiments have shown HGBClassifier (scikit) is less prone to overfit on small data than the older GradientBoostingClassifier, because of these defaults. LightGBM also supports a parameter feature_fraction_bynode which subsamples features at each split; this can help reduce chance of a noisy feature being repeatedly used.
CatBoost: Designed to be robust, it often is the top performer when data is noisy or limited. The ordered boosting means it isn’t fitting to its own mistakes as much. For example, in high-noise situations, CatBoost doesn’t exploit random fluctuations because it treats the data sequence as an online process, adding a bit of randomness to each iteration. The target encoding method also introduces a form of noise in the training (since each category’s statistic is based on a subset, it’s like bagging effect), which can improve resilience. CatBoost’s default random_strength adds noise to splits which can prevent it from zeroing in on what could be just noise patterns. In one anecdotal example, on a dataset with mislabeled examples, CatBoost tended to ignore them (their gradients were not consistently high due to permutation averaging) whereas LightGBM made a branch to correctly classify the outliers, hurting test performance. That said, CatBoost is not magic – if noise is extreme, it will eventually fit some of it unless you stop early. But users have reported that CatBoost usually requires less aggressive parameter regularization to achieve a given generalization level on noisy data. In medical datasets with heterogenous data types and noisy labels, CatBoost has an advantage that you can feed all variables (numerical and categorical) without needing to normalize or carefully preprocess, and it will handle different scales and types robustly.
Summary: All three algorithms are fairly robust to noise compared to say an un-regularized decision tree, because they employ multiple weak learners and have regularization. CatBoost stands out by actively avoiding overfitting to noise via its algorithmic approach, making it a strong choice when you suspect target leakage or have many categorical with potential noise. XGBoost and LightGBM rely more on the user to set parameters that prevent overfitting noise. In a scenario with extremely noisy data (e.g. diagnostic tests with lots of false positives/negatives), one might prefer CatBoost or use XGBoost with very cautious settings (small learning rate, early stopping).
Interpretability
Model Complexity: All three produce an ensemble of decision trees, which can be difficult to interpret directly. Typically, one would use feature importance scores and post-hoc explanation methods to interpret them. XGBoost and LightGBM by default can output feature importance based on gain (how much each feature split improved the objective) or split counts. CatBoost also provides feature importance metrics including its own innovative ones (like PredictionValueChange and LossFunctionChange)
neptune.ai
neptune.ai
. In terms of raw model, XGBoost and LightGBM might produce, say, 1000 trees of depth 6 (so 6000 rules), while CatBoost might produce 100 trees of depth 8 (which is 256 leaves each, but symmetric structure). So CatBoost might use fewer trees; however, each tree’s splits might be on those encoded features which are somewhat abstract. In any case, examining individual trees is usually not enlightening for any of them. Instead, one uses global interpretability tools.
Feature Importance & SHAP: All three support calculation of SHAP values – a popular method to explain individual predictions by attributing to each feature the difference it made. SHAP is model-agnostic but has optimizations for tree models, and it works seamlessly with XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. There are slight differences: CatBoost has a native get_feature_importance(type='ShapValues') which calculates SHAP directly using internal model knowledge. XGBoost/LightGBM typically rely on the Tree SHAP implementation (which is fast). SHAP allows one to say "for this patient, the model’s prediction was 0.8 risk, baseline 0.5, and these features increased the risk (e.g. high blood pressure +0.1, age +0.05, etc.)". This level of interpretability is crucial in healthcare and is equally achievable with any of the three models. Studies have used SHAP on XGBoost to identify important predictors of diseases
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
, and similarly on CatBoost to explain ICU mortality predictions.
Rules and Partial Dependence: Because these are tree models, one can extract decision rules or look at partial dependence plots (PDP) for features. PDP shows the marginal effect of a feature on prediction. This can sometimes reveal intuitive patterns (e.g. risk increases with age up to a point then plateaus). Such analyses have been done with all three. There is nothing inherent in XGBoost vs LightGBM vs CatBoost that makes one more interpretable via PDP; they’re similar because they’re all gradient boosted trees. CatBoost’s symmetric trees mean each tree is a set of binary questions applied to all data, which might slightly simplify global reasoning, but in practice, it’s still a complex ensemble.
Categorical Interpretability: One consideration: when using CatBoost’s target encoding, the model is effectively using transformed features. If you want to understand what “a split value of 0.42 on encoded Feature X” means, you need to translate that back to original categories. It might mean something like “if P(Y=1|Feature X) > 0.42 then...”. This is interpretable to a statistician, but not as directly intuitive as “Feature X = Category A vs B”. In contrast, if you one-hot encode categories and use XGBoost, a tree might have a branch “if Feature_X_A = 1 then ... else ...”, which is very interpretable (“Category A triggers this rule”). So, CatBoost can be slightly harder to directly explain category-specific effects. However, one can always compute the average prediction for each category by feeding data through the model – effectively get a sense of each category’s impact. Also CatBoost offers a feature called Partial Plot specifically for categorical, which shows how prediction changes with each category value (taking into account the encoded nature). Meanwhile, LightGBM’s approach of category splitting means it might be grouping categories in splits (e.g. {A,C,E} vs {B,D} yields one branch). This grouping can be a bit hard to interpret: it means A,C,E have similar effect while B,D are another group. But typically one would not interpret at that level; one would examine feature importance or SHAP for categories. SHAP for a categorical feature can be aggregated by category: e.g. “Male” gets a SHAP value of +0.2 for a specific prediction meaning being male increased risk by 0.2, etc. That works regardless of the underlying encoding.
Tools and Ecosystem: XGBoost being older has a lot of third-party support for interpretation. LightGBM and CatBoost likewise. For instance, the Python SHAP package directly supports all three. LIME (another explainer) can treat the model as a black-box and perturb inputs to see outputs, which works equally on all. CatBoost has an advantage that it has some built-in visualizations for feature importances, and even a tool to calculate something akin to SHAP called PredictionDifference. But these are more convenience than fundamental differences.
Summary: All three methods yield models of similar nature (boosted trees), so their interpretability is comparable. The availability of advanced interpretation techniques like SHAP in recent years has largely leveled the field. A data scientist might choose CatBoost for accuracy on categorical data but then use the same SHAP analysis they would use for XGBoost. In sensitive domains like healthcare, one might favor the model that gives the best validation performance, and then invest effort to explain it via those techniques, rather than picking a weaker model for slightly easier interpretation. In fact, in healthcare research using these boosters, it’s common to see statements like “we used XGBoost (or CatBoost) and then applied SHAP to interpret the feature impacts”. This suggests that whichever of these algorithms yields the best predictive accuracy for the problem can be made explainable with the right tools.
Benchmarks and Healthcare Use Cases
Gradient boosting models have been extensively tested across domains. Generally, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost achieve very similar accuracy on structured data, with differences on specific datasets due to how they handle certain feature types or due to tuning. In academic benchmarks (e.g. on UCI machine learning datasets or Kaggle competitions), one algorithm might edge out the others by a small margin. For instance, Prokhorenkova et al. reported CatBoost outperformed XGBoost and LightGBM on many datasets in terms of final metric
ar5iv.org
, which they attributed to its handling of categoricals and avoidance of prediction shift. Independent studies also show that on purely numerical datasets, LightGBM and XGBoost often tie, whereas on datasets with categorical features CatBoost can win by a small amount. The differences in metrics are often on the order of 0.1% to 1% in accuracy or AUC. In many cases, the top performer’s lead is not statistically significant, especially after both are tuned. In the context of healthcare applications, these algorithms have seen widespread use for tasks such as disease diagnosis prediction, patient outcome modeling, risk stratification, and healthcare resource forecasting. Here are a few notable points and examples:
Disease Prediction Accuracy: Boosted trees often achieve strong results on structured clinical datasets. For example, on a task predicting diabetes onset from health examination data, one study might find all three algorithms achieve an AUC around, say, 0.85 with proper tuning, with differences <0.01. Indeed, in an ICU patient mortality prediction benchmark using eICU data (over 200k admissions), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost all achieved AUROC in the range of 0.84–0.93 across various patient subgroups. CatBoost had a slight edge in many subgroups, but the gap was small (often 0.01 higher AUC). For instance, in neurological patients CatBoost AUC was 0.91 vs 0.90 for XGBoost; in pulmonary patients 0.86 vs 0.84. Such differences are minor in practical terms – all are highly effective, and one would choose based on other considerations (like speed or ease). What it demonstrates is that no single algorithm dominates in all medical datasets; performance is context-dependent.
Effect of Categorical Features: Many healthcare datasets have categorical variables: e.g. patient gender, ethnicity, hospital unit, diagnostic codes, medication categories. CatBoost’s ability to leverage these can sometimes yield better accuracy especially if those features are high-cardinality (like thousands of ICD-10 diagnostic codes). A study on predicting hospital readmission might find CatBoost’s handling of diagnosis codes leads to a better model than one-hot encoding them for XGBoost (which would vastly increase feature count). In a public healthcare dataset with mixed data types, one might see CatBoost outperform XGBoost by a margin (say CatBoost accuracy 92% vs XGBoost 90%) due to such factors. If categorical features are few or very low-cardinality, then this advantage vanishes.
Noise and Missing Data in Healthcare: Healthcare data is notorious for missing values and noise (lab errors, patient non-disclosure, etc.). All three algorithms can handle missing values — XGBoost and LightGBM treat missing as a separate branch effectively, and CatBoost requires missing to be encoded (e.g. as NaN) and then it usually treats them as a separate category or uses the “Min”/“Max” imputation strategy (CatBoost by default treats missing as a special value, placing it either as smaller or larger than all seen values). Robustness to noise can influence performance on healthcare tasks: one study on healthcare claims fraud detection found that LightGBM and CatBoost both handled the noisy, imbalanced data well, with CatBoost slightly more accurate but at the cost of longer training. In another scenario, predicting patient length-of-stay, models had to contend with a lot of variance in outcomes; all three boosters outperformed linear models, but among them performance was roughly tied after tuning.
Computational Constraints: In healthcare, dataset sizes can vary widely. Sometimes one works with a few thousand patients (e.g. a clinical trial), other times millions of records (billing or claims data). If working with a smaller dataset, CatBoost’s advantages in preventing overfit may show up as a clearer win, and training time is not an issue for any of them. If working with a huge dataset (e.g. national insurance claims, millions of rows), the training time and memory might become the bottleneck; in such cases LightGBM’s efficiency might make it the only viable option to train quickly, or XGBoost if we need distributed training on a cluster. There have been instances where XGBoost was chosen in healthcare projects simply because of its maturity and distributed support, even if another algorithm might have been a bit more accurate on a sample, because scaling to full data reliably was key.
Interpretability and Trust: In healthcare AI, model interpretability is crucial. If one algorithm yielded a slight accuracy gain but was much harder to interpret, practitioners might opt for the slightly less accurate but more interpretable solution. In practice, however, as discussed, these three are comparably interpretable with modern tools. All have been used in interpretable healthcare ML studies. For example, an XGBoost model for thyroid cancer recurrence was interpreted with SHAP to identify influential clinical factors, and a CatBoost model for ICU mortality was explained with SHAP and partial dependence to validate it was using sensible features. The ability to explain model decisions helped build trust in deploying these models. Thus, the choice among XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost often comes down to technical factors rather than interpretability differences.
In summary, for healthcare applications all three algorithms have proven their value. They often outperform linear models and even neural networks when data is tabular and relatively small. XGBoost is historically popular and well-tested in medical ML tasks. LightGBM is used when one needs faster experimentation or is dealing with very large datasets. CatBoost is increasingly popular especially when the data involves many categorical fields (such as hospital codes, device types, etc.) or when overfitting is a concern due to limited samples. In a benchmark by Safaei et al. on ICU data, CatBoost slightly outperformed XGBoost/LightGBM in most of 12 patient cohorts, but all three significantly outperformed traditional severity scoring systems like APACHE and SOFA – highlighting that the choice of using gradient boosting itself is more important than which flavor. The differences between algorithms were secondary, and the ensemble of gradient boosting methods as a whole was far more accurate than older medical indexes. Finally, a note on problem/data suitability:
XGBoost/LightGBM vs CatBoost for different data: If your data is all numeric and you have a very large sample size, LightGBM may be the go-to due to speed. If your data has tricky categoricals or is smaller, CatBoost might give you a boost with less effort.
If ultimate accuracy is paramount, it can be beneficial to try all three and even ensemble them. They are similar enough that their predictions are usually correlated, but in competitions people have ensemble XGBoost and LightGBM to squeeze out an extra fraction of a percent. For a single model choice, many practitioners try XGBoost first (given its reliability), then LightGBM if speed is needed, and CatBoost if they see a lot of categorical data or if XGBoost isn’t performing as well as hoped.
Conclusion
Gradient boosting algorithms have revolutionized machine learning on structured data, and XGBoost, LightGBM (HistGradientBoosting), and CatBoost represent the state-of-the-art implementations with their own strengths. XGBoost introduced regularized objectives and remains a robust, well-understood choice with a balance of performance and flexibility. LightGBM/HGB optimized the algorithm for speed and scalability, utilizing histogram bins and leaf-wise growth to handle huge datasets quickly – often with almost no drop in accuracy. CatBoost took a different direction, solving specific pitfalls related to categorical features and small-data overfitting, thereby providing an out-of-the-box solution that often excels without extensive data preprocessing. For a data scientist, the detailed mathematics of these algorithms – from XGBoost’s second-order expansion and split scoring, to LightGBM’s histogram aggregation, to CatBoost’s ordered boosting – provide insight into why they perform so well and how they differ. When deciding which to use, one should consider the nature of the dataset (feature types, size) and the requirements (speed, interpretability, slightly higher accuracy, etc.). In many cases, all three will yield a highly accurate model, and practical considerations (like training time or ease of deployment) drive the choice. In the healthcare domain, these algorithms have enabled predictive models that improve upon traditional statistical scores in tasks like patient mortality prediction, disease diagnosis, and treatment outcome forecasting. They do so while allowing explanations via techniques such as SHAP, helping to maintain transparency in critical applications. As of 2025, all three frameworks continue to be actively developed (with XGBoost and LightGBM adding more categorical support, and CatBoost improving speed and features), and they form an essential toolkit for any machine learning practitioner dealing with tabular data. The deep theoretical grounding and the numerous practical enhancements in XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost exemplify how machine learning research and development can dramatically push the performance envelope while catering to real-world needs like speed, scalability, and interpretability.
